Am very excited to be in the tech industry since its a field that is always evolving; there is always something new to learn so that you arent left behind and get outdated with time. Recently ave been finding software developing using (MERN) interesting since you can come up with your own software and am headed to adding it on my skills set. As we are advancing in the digital era of AI i also believe AI for software development will go in handy
On the other side am eager to explore software testing which also seems to be soo much marketable as much as it is interesting to me.
